# Imperial Thesis

## Context 

This repository contains my work for the Imperial College Master thesis project, in the scope of Applied Machine Learning course in Electrical and Electronic Engineering department.

My goal is to be able to spot liver diseases (for mice, humans, or any living being), based on the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of the liver cells of these living beings.

I will apply various Machine Learning algorithms to find relevant insights on these data.
